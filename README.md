# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview
Does the Amazon Vine program produce bias towards favorable reviews? To answer the question, I examined just one of Amazon's large datasets on the health and personal care vertical. 

Amazon Vine is a program that enables a select group of Amazon customers to post opinions about new and pre-release items to help their fellow customers to make educated purchasing decisions. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results
Looking at the data, the following questions for unpaid and paid program reviews were answered.
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
